# YoutubeTwitchClipUploader
An Automated Twitch Clip Uploader to Youtube (With an option for Twitter API auto-posting)

Uses both the Twitch API, Youtube API, and Tweepy API to download twitch clips that reupload to Youtube and sends out a message of the new posted video on Twitter.

To get started on how to use the social media APIs, I recommend checking out their documentation:

Tweepy API
